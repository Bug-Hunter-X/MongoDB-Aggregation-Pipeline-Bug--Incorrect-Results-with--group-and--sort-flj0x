# MongoDB Aggregation Pipeline Bug

This repository demonstrates a subtle bug encountered when using the MongoDB aggregation pipeline with the `$group` and `$sort` stages together. The issue results in incorrect aggregation results.

## Bug Description
The provided code uses an aggregation pipeline to group documents by a field, count occurrences, sort by count, and limit the result set.  The bug manifests as the pipeline not correctly sorting the grouped results, leading to an incorrect top-10 list.  The root cause might be due to an implicit type conversion or interaction between stages that is not immediately apparent. 

## Bug Reproduction
1.  Clone this repository.
2.  Ensure you have a MongoDB instance running and the necessary MongoDB driver installed (`npm install mongodb`).
3.  Run `node bug.js`.  Compare the output against the expected output, which should be the 10 most frequent documents, correctly sorted.
4.  Inspect the `bugSolution.js` file for a solution. 

## Solution
The solution provides a corrected pipeline that produces the expected output. Note that this might involve adjusting the pipeline stages, adding explicit type casting or handling, or altering the way grouping and sorting are performed to ensure that the sorting operates correctly.
